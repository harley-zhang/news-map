This collaborative project between [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/) and [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) explores "content deserts", neighborhoods where local news coverage is either overly focused on certain topics or inadequately meets the communityâ€™s information needs to highlight imbalances and gaps in news coverage.

## Data

This app will be tested a proof-of-concept in the Greater New York City Area using [The City](https://www.thecity.nyc/) and [New York Post](https://nypost.com/) coverage, [US Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html), and population data for normalization. 

## Information

- Number of articles at specific points
- Number of articles at specific ZIP codes
- Articles per capita at specific ZIP codes
- Population at specific ZIP codes
